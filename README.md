# ADNIDatasets

Package for working with data from the ALzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initaitive in Julia. 

ADNI is an excellent, open data initiative set up to share longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging data relevant to Alzheimer's diseaes. However, data from ADNI is notoriously hard to work with. This package is an effort to make working with ADNI data easier. 

At present, the package mainly supports analysis of PET neuroimaging data that is analysed using the FreeSurfer DKT atlas, for example the myloid-beta AV45 and tau AV1451 tracers. 

This is a very lightweight packages that simply reads and reorganises tabular data from ADNI.
